I am a PhD student at the University of Glasgow under the supervision of [Prof Wim Vanderbauwhede](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~wim/) and [Dr Syed Waqar Nabi](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~waqar/).

My work focuses on building compilers to accelerate scientific models using heterogeneous architectures (in particular FPGAs), to achieve higher performance per watt. The vision is that domain scientists keep writing programs in their familiar language (this is mostly Fortran for weather models), and the compiler takes over the job of mapping the code to the best architecture and transforming it to fit the available resources.

This builds on [years of existing work](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?as_q=&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_occt=any&as_sauthors=vanderbauwhede%2Cnabi&as_publication=&as_ylo=2014&as_yhi=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5) done by my supervisors and others.
